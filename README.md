# Chess in React

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of chess using react. I it wrote as a way to strength my skills in ths library and in Javascript in general, as well as to gain experience in completing and deploying web projects. 

## Features
* Chess rules are enforced by calculating the legal moves for each piece and only allowing the player to make one of those moves.
* Piece movements are animated!
* All pervious moves are logged to the "Moves" box.

## How to Play
Starting with white, the player may select any piece of the current color by clicking it. Each space they can move that piece to will be displayed in red, and they may move the piece to one of these spaces by clicking it.
